    <h4>
        <mark><strong>Company Code:</strong></mark>
        The company code you created during your account registration is how your employees link their account to yours. Make sure to clearly distribute your ‘company name’ and ‘company code’ to your employees (can be found in the info tab if forgotten). Employees can then use this information to register for an account.

    <h4>
        <mark><strong>Shift Titles:</strong></mark>
        Cync works around the titles created by you and your company/management team. In short titles are job titles that include shift start and end times. An example for a restaurant would be ‘Server: 4:00-12:00’. You must also specify what day this is for as well as how many you may need. Begin creating shift titles in the title page! (NOTE: Be sure to manually input shift start and end times)

    <h4>
        <mark><strong>Schedule:</strong></mark>
        Once employees create their accounts they can browse all created titles and add it to their availability. In turn you can begin to form an official schedule! Add and remove team members to the finalized schedule under the schedule tab.
